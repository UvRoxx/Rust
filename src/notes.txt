This is an unorganized collection of curious questions


1)What is the difference between use abc; and mod abc;?
For example I need to do use std::env; if I want to access stuff in the std::env namespace.
But I canâ€™t do the same thing for a module contained in the my own project (crate?).
Instead I have to do mod mymod; to make the contents of mymod accessible from current scope.
Why do have two ways of doing the same thing?

ANS-mod abc; declares a module.use abc;brings a nameabc` into scope.
 rust - Python
-mod = import
-use = from
This is because of the Rust Prelude: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/
